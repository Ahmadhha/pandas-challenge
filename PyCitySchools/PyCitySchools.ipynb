    "<br><br>\n",
    "2. From section [9] it is evident that there is an inverse relationship between school spending per student and over all passing rate, where lower spending schools yeild better results than higher spending ones. This is an unexpected observation that requires further investigation.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "3. From section [10] it is evident that large schools with over 2000 students perform significantly worse than schools with under 2000 students in terms of over all passing. This could hint at a certain capacity beyond which school performance begins to deteriorate. Further investigation and finer data resolution is required to clarify the reason behind this observation."
